**Recall**, also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate, is a crucial evaluation metric used in machine learning, particularly in binary classification tasks. Recall measures the ability of a model to identify all relevant instances of a particular class, indicating how well the model avoids false negatives.

Recall is defined as:


$$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}$$
Recall (R) = $\( \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \)$

In this formula:

- **True Positives (TP)** are the number of instances that were correctly predicted as positive by the model.
- **False Negatives (FN)** are the number of instances that were incorrectly predicted as negative when they were actually positive.

TODO:
   - Limitations
   - Give example

Recall (R) = \( \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \)
