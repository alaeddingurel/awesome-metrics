**F1-Score** is a widely used evaluation metric in machine learning, especially in binary classification tasks. It combines both precision and recall to provide a single score that balances the trade-off between making positive predictions and ensuring that those predictions are accurate.

The F1-Score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall:

\[ \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \]

In this formula:

- **Precision** is the metric that measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall** is the metric that measures the ability to identify all relevant positive instances.
